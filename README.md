# sea-ice-floe-segmentation
## Description
This repository contains a user-friendly, MATLAB live script to easily and automatically segment sea ice floes (chunks) in imagery (for example, from satellites or aerial platforms).

The algorithm and code was written by Alexis Denton (Yale University) for and used to segment high-resolution optical satellite images in the accompanying submitted manuscript (preprint, in review) coauthored with Mary-Louise Timmermans (Yale University), Denton and Timmermans (2021) (https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2021-368). The research presented in the manuscript was funded by the Office of Naval Research as a part of their Multi-University Research Initiative (MURI) Mathematics and Data Science for Physical Modeling and Prediction of Sea Ice. To learn more about the work of the Sea Ice MURI, please visit https://seaicemuri.org/. 

For further details about the algorithm, please see Denton and Timmermans (2021).
